This is a very rough and ready puppet provisioning manifest for the development virtual machine.
It installs:
- Apache
-- mod_rewrite
- PHP and all the trimmings
- PEAR
- PHPUnit
- MySQL
- Outbound mail

The /src file within the host project is mapped to /var/www/src, so visiting 127.0.0.1:4567/src takes you to that directory
Port forwarding for MySQL doesn't seem to be correctly in place, so connect with an SSH tunnel to the machine directly.
